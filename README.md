# ProjectFlashback

Project Description:

Flashback is a learning application intended for entry-level programmers. Administrator users are able to make and add to study sets, while users, even unregistered, are able to quiz themselves upon the material. Registered users are able to leave comments and participate in the 'Recall forums', where confused individuals may come and ask questions to the large userbase. Registered users are also able to view and change their profile information, as well as view their total score.

Technologies Used:

Java, Maven, JUnit, Mockito, AWS EC2, AWS S3, Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, MongoDB, Spring Data, Spring Boot, Spring AOP, Spring Framework, Spring MVC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Agile-Scrum, Postman, NodeJS, REST
